        <h3>What have I learned from this project?</h3>
        <p>In this project, we worked in teams to develop a customer journey based on one of Elbolaget AB's primary customers, the persona "Emma". The goal was to get the customer's positive and negative thoughts and opinions about general electricity companies and Elbolaget AB.</p>
        <p>The project was designed in three stages;</p>

                <h3>Who is the customer journey based on?</h3>
                <p>Emma is a teacher with a hectic life. She teaches social sciences and history. Usually, Emma goes to work early every morning and usually she ends her days by exercising and unwinding by watching series. Her favorite activities in her spare time are eating at a restaurant and meeting friends. But she often feels that time is not enough. She dreams of finding a partner and having children and becoming financially independent to control more of her own time. But time is not always enough and the energy for the romantic is not there right now.</p>
                <p>Emma makes sure to invest regularly to achieve her goal of financial independence. Emma has a good track record of world news and the social issue that concerns her the most is the environment. During her life, she has been most interested in soft sciences such as psychology, gender studies, social sciences, etc.m. Emma's consumer choice is often influenced by her friends as well as her ethical and moral positions.</p>

                <h3>Interview & Observation</h3>
                <p>The person we chose to interview was a member of our group who was not familiar with the prototype before but was well-read on the persona "Emma". The aim was to develop more in-depth preferences regarding "Emma's" general and specific opinions and thoughts about electricity companies, electricity contracts, and Elbolaget AB.</p>
                <p>The observation was prepared by first selecting three User Stories that "Emma" was instructed to test. The purpose was to follow "Emma's" customer experience without affecting her thoughts or behavior to get data about whether pages or interactions on the website affected her customer experience. To collect material from the observations, we took notes and started a screen recording and audio recording with approval where we in the team could afterward follow her navigation.</p>

                <h3>Processing</h3>
                <p>The interview was transcribed and in FigJam we started creating a sketch for "Emma's" customer journey. We started from the matrix of activity, goals, touchpoints, feelings/thoughts/responses, and improvement suggestions on the X-axis and the phases discover, compare, consider, commit and retain on the y-axis. We filled in the answers we investigated from interviews and observation at each location in the matrix.</p>
                <p>Based on feelings/thoughts/feedback, we estimated on a 5-point scale how satisfied or dissatisfied our test person was with the prototype. The results of satisfaction form a chart. It illustrates the areas of the customer journey that are most relevant for this test person and persona to improve in the future development of Elbolaget AB's customer service.</p>
