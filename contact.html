            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>It all started in high school where I studied behavioral science and began to take an interest in how we humans act in certain situations. Studying people could almost be called my hobby as I am a person connoisseur and observe everything around me.</p>
            <p>After graduation, I packed my bags and headed for Lund University. Since I struggled to find my way, I decided that the trip would be the goal. How was I supposed to know what I want to work with if I didn’t explore? Once in Lund, I studied a course in Media and Communication Studies. I learned everything from how to navigate complex media landscapes to how a small Toblerone can play a significant role in politics.</p>
            <p>After exploring Media and Communication Studies, I started reading more and more about UX design. What if I could combine design and research in my future profession? That sounded like a dream! So far during my dream education, I have not decided whether UI or UX is what I will focus on. I think I'll be able to figure that out along the way, as the trip is the goal.</p>
