                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>I created a persona based on qualitative and quantitative questionnaires in this project. The goal was to create a student persona and analyze this target group's opinion on general electricity companies and the made-up electricity company "Elbolaget AB".</p>
                <p>My role: I was in charge of making a survey and creating an infographic for my persona.</p>

                <h3>Survey</h3>
                <p>I started the project by writing questions tailored to these six topics:</p>
                <div id="minArrayDiv"></div>
            <p>I also divided the survey into two parts, where the first part intended general perceptions about electricity companies. Meanwhile, the second part covered questions about specifically Elbolaget AB.</p>
            <p>I published the questions in a Google Form sheet and sent out the form to eight students when the questions were completed. Once I received the responses, I could easily pick out the six areas to create my persona.</p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>The results showed that my persona is a student woman of 22 years. She makes environmentally conscious consumer choices, wants cheap electricity and doesn't like long queues for customer service.</p>
                <p>I presented my persona to the stakeholder by addressing the insights of the six different areas. Then I also explained how I chose to formulate my questions for the survey and how I chose to divide the form.</p>
                <p>Finally, I pointed out the importance of starting my persona in upcoming design processes for Elbolaget AB because it represents its users.</p>

        <h3>What have I learned from this project?</h3>
        <p>This project was very rewarding for me as I got to try both UX research and UI. The difficulty of the project was formulating questions that covered the six different topics of the persona template.</p>
        <p>To solve this obstacle, I enlisted the help of my classmates and asked my course leader questions. Thus, today I have learned what kinds of questions I will use in future projects to get important information.</p>
