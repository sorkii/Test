        <h3>About the project</h3>
        <p>In this project, we worked in different teams for over 5 weeks. The project was divided into five different sprints where we were assigned new assignments by the stakeholder every week. Overall, we would analyze different electricity companies' websites and then create a prototype for an imaginary electricity company called Elbolaget AB.</p>
        <p>In the first sprint, we investigated existing electricity companies' websites and analyzed these. Furthermore, in the second sprint, the team started to put together simple wireframes for our website. In the third sprint, we worked more in-depth with user stories. Continued in sprint four, we performed user tests on our prototype. Finally, in the fifth and final sprint, we made a final design for our prototype with more color and finesse based on the results of our user tests.</p>
        <p>The team: Siri Moström, Mark Miasnikov, Klara Lindberg, Elin Malmgren & Jennie Müller.</p>
        <p>My role: Researcher, Scrum Master, UI designer.</p>

            <h3>Sprint 1: Research</h3>
            <p>In the first sprint of the project, the team began by creating a Kanban board and appointing this week's Scrum Master. Furthermore, we were given the task of evaluating and analyzing different electricity companies' websites by starting from different tasks. These tasks were then converted to User Stories and graded on a 5-point scale. I chose to analyze Göta Energi's website for this task.</p>

            <h3>Sprint 2: Wireframes</h3>
            <p>In the second sprint, the team began to create the different User Stories to begin the creation of wireframes on Elbolaget AB's website. I was assigned to design User Story: "Where do I find phone numbers?" and User Story: "Find smart environment tips".</p>
            <p>I chose to create a customer service page that contains a contact page. On the page, there are "FAQs", contact details, a call to action to "log in", and opening hours to customer service. The layout I created is inspired by existing electricity companies' websites.</p>
            <p>It was very insightful for me to only work with black/white colors because the function should be the focus of this sprint. Furthermore, in the project we also did user tests and then it was important that the user would test function and not analyze colors and shapes.</p>

    <h3>Sprint 3: User Stories</h3>
    <p>In the third sprint, our User Stories changed and the team had to redo our wireframes in Figma.</p>
    <p>In this sprint, I was assigned these User Stories;</p>
    <p>User Story: As a new user, I want to know what payment options are available so I can plan my transactions.</p>
    <p>User Story: As a new user, I want to be able to spread out the annual cost over the year so I can plan my finances</p>

            <h3>Sprint 4: User Testing</h3>
            <p>In our fourth sprint, it was time to perform user tests on our website. Everyone on the team had to be responsible for their own User Stories and find willing test subjects.</p>
            <p>I chose to test my design on three different people to get a reasonable result. During the test, I gave the test person a User Story, and then they had to navigate around the website themselves to find the right one. In a chart, I wrote down what each respondent thought was good or bad with the feature, while I kept my notes to find key insights. From the user tests, I learned that others can usually see things that you would never notice. Some discoveries became very important for my upcoming design process.</p>

            <h3>Sprint 5: Final design process</h3>
            <p>In the fifth and final sprint, I honed the design for my frames. I changed the design after collecting information from the Sprint 4 user tests. An example of improvement suggestions from one of the test subjects was to adjust the layout and text size of one of the pages.</p>
            <p>For the design work, the team created a common design guide that we all started from in our design creation. The team arranged a structured design in Figma where we all worked together on our prototype. I thought it was fun and rewarding with the design process and being creative. I learned a lot during sprint five through inspiration from my team members who I will take with me to the next project.</p>

<section class="what-have-i-learned-elbolaget">
    <h3>What have I learned from this project?</h3>
    <p>This project was one of the largest I have worked with at the IT-högskolan and I learned everything from how to work in teams to how to design a button in the best way. Some parts of the project were quite difficult to manage and I got stuck. But luckily I ended up in a cooperative group so most obstacles we could solve together.</p>
    <p>Working agile was something completely new to me, but I quickly noticed that sprint work was my thing. It was very easy to keep track of your moments through the process while keeping your time estimation. Therefore, I believe that agile methods will benefit both myself and future workplaces.</p>
